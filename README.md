# BananaRipenessDetectionLevel-KMeansAlgorithm

#### ‚≠ê Project Name : Banana Ripeness Level with Brown Spots Detection 
#### ‚åõ Related Class : Digital Image Processing
#### üîë Keywords : k-means clustering, segmentation, pixel areas, color distance.
##### Description : Detection of bananas' ripeness level by measuring the ratio of its brown spots and yellow part areas using image processing techniques.


##### Here is an output example of the ripeness detection process of a banana image. Feel free to read the IEEE report for more detailed information!
